Hi, I'm @rachitaravishankar a bioinformatics research assistant at the Newcastle University. 
Some of the projects I am working on include:
- Microarray Analysis of publicly available datasets using R to support immune regulation studies.
- Single and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis to understand tumour microenvironment of Birt-Hogg-Dube skin tumour and Cylindroma skin tumour.
